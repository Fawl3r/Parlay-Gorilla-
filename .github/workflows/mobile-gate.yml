# Pre-deploy gate: mobile regression (Gorilla Builder + AI Picks) against production.
# Fails block merge/deploy. Artifacts uploaded so Cursor can diagnose quickly.
# If Render auto-deploys from main, blocking merges = blocking deploys.
# If you deploy from tags or another branch, add a duplicate job with that trigger.
