# Custom Parlay Builder

The Custom Parlay Builder lets you build your own ticket and have it analyzed by the model.

Core actions:
- Analyze: Review confidence, implied odds, and risk notes for your custom ticket.
- Counter: Generate a counter-parlay that hedges against your original legs.
- Coverage Pack: Generate multiple tickets to cover upset scenarios.

What the analysis includes:
- Per-leg confidence and edge metrics.
- A combined probability estimate for the full parlay.
- Highlighted weak and strong legs.

Usage limits:
- Free users have a limited number of custom builder actions per rolling 7-day window.
- Premium users have included monthly usage, with optional credit overage.

Tip: If a leg is marked as a weak link, consider swapping it or reducing the total number of legs.
