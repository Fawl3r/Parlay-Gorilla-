# AI Parlay Generator

The AI Parlay Generator suggests parlays based on current odds, model confidence, and your selected risk profile.

How it works:
- You choose a sport (or mix multiple sports if available).
- You choose a risk profile: conservative, balanced, or degen.
- The model selects a set of legs and generates an explanation with risk notes.

Why some requests return no picks:
- Odds may not be loaded for the selected sport.
- There may be no upcoming games in the selected window.
- The model may filter out low-confidence legs.

Usage limits:
- Free users have a limited number of AI parlays per rolling 7-day window.
- Premium users have a larger rolling monthly allowance.
- Credits can be used when free or premium limits are exhausted.

Tip: If you see a "no eligible picks" message, try a different sport or check back later when odds update.
