# Troubleshooting

Common issues and quick fixes:

1) "No eligible picks were available"
- Odds might not be loaded for the selected sport.
- Try a different sport or check back later.

2) "Paywall" or "Limit reached"
- Free limits are based on rolling usage windows.
- Premium plans increase limits and unlock additional tools.
- Credits can be used when limits are exhausted.

3) "Gorilla Bot is unavailable"
- The assistant is temporarily offline or maintenance is in progress.
- Try again in a few minutes.

4) "Profile setup required"
- Some features require a completed profile.
- Go to the Profile page and finish setup.
