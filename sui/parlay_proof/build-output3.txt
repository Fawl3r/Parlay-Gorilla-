warning[Lint W99010]: unnecessary `entry` on a `public` function
   ΓöîΓöÇ .\sources\parlay_proof.move:25:12

25 Γöé     public entry fun create_proof(data_hash: vector<u8>, created_at: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext) {
   Γöé            ^^^^^ `entry` on `public` functions limits composability as it adds restrictions, e.g. the type of each return value must have `drop`. `entry` on `public` is only meaningful in niche scenarios.
   Γöé
   = `public` functions can be called from PTBs. `entry` can be used to allow non-`public` functions to be called from PTBs, but it adds restrictions on the usage of input arguments and on the type of return values. Unless this `public` function interacts with an intricate set of other `entry` functions, the `entry` modifier should be removed.
   = This warning can be suppressed with '#[allow(lint(public_entry))]' applied to the 'module' or module member ('const', 'fun', or 'struct')
