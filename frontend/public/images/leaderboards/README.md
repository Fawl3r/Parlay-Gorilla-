# Leaderboards background

Place the branded leaderboard background image here as:

- **Filename:** `leaderboards-bg.png`
- **Suggested source:** The Parlay Gorilla promotional banner (dark, neon-green stadium scene). If you have it as `leaderboard.png` in `public/images/`, copy it here and rename to `leaderboards-bg.png`.

The LeaderboardHeroBackground component loads it from `/images/leaderboards/leaderboards-bg.png`.
